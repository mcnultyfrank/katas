// Adding Parity Bits

// Parity bits are used as a very simple checksum to ensure that binary data isn't corrupted during transit. Here's how they work:
// If a binary string has an odd number of 1's, the parity bit is a 1.
// If a binary string has an even number of 1's, the parity bit is a 0.
// The parity bit is appended to the end of the binary string.
// Create a function that adds the correct parity bit to a binary string.

    const addParityBit = (bitString) => {
        const ones = [];
        splitString = bitString.split('');
        for (let i = 0; i < splitString.length; i++) {
            if (splitString[i] === '1'){
                ones.push(parseInt(splitString[i]))
            }
        }
        ones.length%2 == 0 ? splitString.push('0') : splitString.push('1');
        return splitString.join('');
    }

    addParityBit('0010110');

    module.exports = addParityBit;
