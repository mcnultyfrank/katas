// Adding Parity Bits

// Parity bits are used as a very simple checksum to ensure that binary data isn't corrupted during transit. Here's how they work:
// If a binary string has an odd number of 1's, the parity bit is a 1.
// If a binary string has an even number of 1's, the parity bit is a 0.
// The parity bit is appended to the end of the binary string.
// Create a function that adds the correct parity bit to a binary string.

// Worked Example
// addParityBit("1011011") ➞ "10110111"

// // There are five 1's.
// // Since five is odd, the parity bit should be a 1.
// // Add the parity bit to the end of the string.
// // Return the result.
// Examples
// addParityBit("0010110") ➞ "00101101"
// addParityBit("1100000") ➞ "11000000"
// addParityBit("1111111") ➞ "11111111"
